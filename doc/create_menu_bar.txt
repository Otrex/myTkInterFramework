HOW TO CREATE MENUBAR
---------------------

Menu Bar is one of the most important features of an app
It is usuall attached to the 'root' i.e tk.Tk() or controller
It can be changed by a page by 

controller.config(menu=<menu-instance>)

It is created from the tk.Menu
We give only to types of menu features for now, that is

HorizontalMenu
DropdownMenu

1. HorizontalMenu(root, **{labels:commands}) : In this it creates a horizontal menu bars
It can also accept a dropdown menu too.
To do such, 
	define a menu instance
	e.g menu = tk.Menu(root)
		drop = DropdownMenu(...)
		menubar = HorizontalMenu(root, **{labels:{'menu': drop, 'label':<urlabel>}})

After which your must add your HorzonalMenu instance to the root config

		root.config(menu=menubar)

2. DropdownMenu(parent, menuattr={}, sep=[pos-n, (int)], menubtns={labels:comand})

To create a drop down, first instantial a tk.Menu
i.e
	m = tk.Menu(root)

pass the m as parent for the dropdown
then configure it to the root 'root.config(menu=m)'

the parent can also be another dropdown instance, if you want to create nest of options
