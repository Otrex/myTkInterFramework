HOW TO USE THE OBJECT DATA STRUCTURE
------------------------------------

The Object data structure is built to work like the javascript objects

obj = Object(<datas, >)

initializes it
You can store both functions and other variables in it

METHODS
-------
._dict() :This returns a python dictionary of all its contents
._values(): This returns only the values stored


ACCESSING THE DATA
------------------
You can either use 'Object_instance['<property>'] or just 'Object_instance.property'

ITERATION
---------
It also supports iteration

OPERATION THAT CAN BE PERFORMED
-------------------------------

'-' : It supports the subtraction operation. i.e Obj_instance1 - Obj_instance2
when you subtract, it would return a new Obj_instance with only values that are not
Obj_instance2 

'+' : Similar to the subtraction, This one joins the two instances together
